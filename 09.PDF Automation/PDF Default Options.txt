Note

If the PDF is opened with Adobe Reader DC Acrobat, 
there might be a few steps to take before you can 
extract specific elements using UiPath studio methods. 
Start Acrobat and press Ctrl+K. That opens the Preferences 
pop-up. Select Reading, out of the categories on the left 
panel. Verify that the drop down Reading Order options is 
set to the Acrobat recommended option, 'Infer reading order 
from document (recommended)', 'Page vs. Document': should be 
set to 'Read the entire document' and 'Confirm before tagging 
documents' should be unchecked. Then on the left panel, click 
Accessibility. In the Other Accessibility Options section, 
check the first two boxes if they are not already checked: 
'Use document structure for tab order when no explicit tab 
order is specified', 'Enable assistive technology support', 
and click OK.
